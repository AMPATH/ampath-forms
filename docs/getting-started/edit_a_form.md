# Edit a Form

## Step 1. Find the form

Search for the form you want to work on using the search input at the top right hand section of the forms. Alternatively, use the pagination controls at the bottom of the page to navigate the forms list.

## Step 2. Launch the form in Edit mode

Click on the pen icon icon next to the right of the form name in the forms list to launch it in the schema editor.

You should see the form schema rendered in the schema editor.

## Step 3. Make changes to your form

You can begin to make amendments to the form schema. Note that you can see a visual representation of your amended form at any time by clicking the `Render` button at the bottom of the page. Provided your form schema is valid, the form engine should render the form and update its visual representation. You can then click on the `Form Viewer` tab at the top of the page to reveal the updated visual representation.

## Step 4. Save your form

When you're done making changes to your form, click `File` and select `Save to Server`.

If you want to overwrite the existing form schema, select `Update current version`. Otherwise, if you want to save the schema as a new version, select `Save as new version`.
