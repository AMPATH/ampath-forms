# Core Concepts

AMPATH forms provide a powerful structure for working with forms and data. This guide will walk you through its underlying core concepts.

## **Form**

A form is a collection of form fields. Forms are described using schemas written in JSON. The most basic form schema looks as follows:

```json
{
  "name": "",
  "pages": [],
  "processor": "EncounterFormProcessor",
  "uuid": "xxxx",
  "referencedForms": []
}
```

Form schemas get constructed using the Schema Editor. When you launch the Schema Editor, you get presented with a default form scaffold that looks like the example schema shown above. The default schema comprises of the following:

- `name`: The name of the form. Presently, form names must contain the word POC to be considered valid.
- `uuid`: The unique form UUID. The form UUID is autogenerated by the form builder when you create and save a form successfully.
- `referencedForms`: The collection of components that the form references. Components are reusable forms that encapsulate related logic. You can build a form iteratively by adding components to it using the **Reference Forms** feature of the form builder. Read more about referencing forms in the [Referencing forms](/platform/referencing-forms) guide.

- `pages`: A collection of pages that make up a form. You can add pages to a form by adding page definitions to the pages collection. Pages are made up of sections. Read more about pages in the [Page](/platform/core-concepts#page) guide.

- `processor`: Defaults to `EncounterFormProcessor`.

## Page

Each page in your form schema gets rendered in a separate tab in the form viewer, so a page can be thought of as a way to encapsulate related form logic. Below is an example of a page definition for a page capturing information related to an encounter. This page definition consists of a page **label**, `Encounter Details` and a **sections** array. The page has one section labelled `Encounter Info`. That section, in turn, has two questions labelled `Provider` and `Facility Name`, respectively.

```json
{
  "pages": [
    {
      "label": "Encounter Details",
      "sections": [
        {
          "label": "Encounter Info",
          "isExpanded": "true",
          "questions": [
            {
              "type": "encounterProvider",
              "label": "Provider",
              "id": "provider",
              "required": "true",
              "default": "",
              "questionOptions": {
                "rendering": "ui-select-extended"
              }
            },
            {
              "type": "encounterLocation",
              "label": "Facility name (site/satellite clinic required)",
              "id": "location",
              "required": "true",
              "questionOptions": {
                "rendering": "ui-select-extended"
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Here's how this page definition gets rendered in the Form Viewer.

![Sample page](/img/page.png)

In practice, your form will likely have more than one page. As mentioned before, each page gets rendered as a tab in the form viewer. You can cycle through the pages by clicking the forward and back buttons at the bottom of the page. You can also click on a specific tab header to open that page. Here's how a form with multiple pages would look like:

![Page with sections](/img/page-with-sections.png)

## Section

A section is an element of a form schema that groups together related questions. Sections will be rendered in "collapsed mode" by default. Set `isExpanded` to `true` in the section definition if you want to render the section in "expanded mode".

There are two ways to build section definitions in AMPATH forms:

1. Constructing the section definition _manually_ by providing a section **label** and a **questions** array, and optionally, an **isExpanded** boolean value:

```json
{
  "pages": [
    {
      "label": "Encounter Details",
      "sections": [
        {
          "label": "Encounter Details",
          "isExpanded": "true",
          "questions": [
            {
              "label": "Visit date",
              "type": "encounterDatetime",
              "required": "true",
              "default": "",
              "id": "encDate",
              "questionOptions": {
                "rendering": "date"
              },
              "validators": [
                {
                  "type": "date"
                }
              ]
            },
            {
              "type": "encounterProvider",
              "label": "Provider",
              "id": "provider",
              "required": "true",
              "default": "",
              "questionOptions": {
                "rendering": "ui-select-extended"
              }
            },
            {
              "type": "encounterLocation",
              "label": "Facility name",
              "id": "location",
              "required": "true",
              "questionOptions": {
                "rendering": "ui-select-extended"
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

2. Referencing sections from component forms _imported in_ using the [Reference forms](/platform/referencing-forms) feature.

```json
{
  // reference forms
  "referencedForms": [
    {
      "formName": "component_lab-orders",
      "alias": "lo",
      "ref": {
        "uuid": "ba985719-b085-419c-a0c7-3f1c3e61dd3e",
        "display": "Lab Orders Component"
      }
    },
    {
      "formName": "component_art",
      "alias": "art",
      "ref": {
        "uuid": "bd4ff44f-8007-49b0-b468-669fe0125093",
        "display": "Anti-Retroviral Therapy Component"
      }
    },
  ]

  // and then use the references to build up sections
  {
    "pages": [
      {
        "label": "Plan",
        "sections": [
          {
            "reference": {
              "form": "lo",
              "page": "Test orders",
              "section": "Test Orders"
            }
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "label": "Medication Plan",
        "sections": [
          {
            "reference": {
              "form": "art",
              "page": "ART ",
              "section": "ART Plan",
              "excludeQuestions": [
                "artStartedPed"
              ]
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Question

A question is a field in the form. Below is an example of a question that seeks to establish the patient's `Current HIV status`:

```json
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "label": "Current HIV status",
      "type": "obs",
      "questionOptions": {
        "rendering": "select",
        "concept": "9e4d6436-4040-46a3-a0ae-6dbc0acfe593",
        "answers": [
          {
            "concept": "a896f3a6-1350-11df-a1f1-0026b9348838",
            "label": "HIV positive"
          },
          {
            "concept": "a896d2cc-1350-11df-a1f1-0026b9348838",
            "label": "HIV negative"
          },
          {
            "concept": "a899b50a-1350-11df-a1f1-0026b9348838",
            "label": "Unknown"
          }
        ]
      },
      "validators": []
    }
  ]
}
```

All questions have a **label**, and **id**, a **rendering** type**,** and a set of **answers**. Here's a reference of the various properties you can specify in a question definition:

- `label`: The actual content of the question. This is what gets rendered as the question label.
- `id`: An ID unique to that question. Used when validating the field input.
- `questionOptions`: An object containing the following properties:

  - `rendering`: The field type of the question. The most common field types are **text** (for text inputs), **select** (for select fields) and **date** (for date fields). See the **Field types** reference below for a full list of rendering types.
  - `concept`: Optional. The concept UUID of the backing concept for this field.
  - `answers`: An array of answers scoped to a question. An answer definition consists of a concept UUID and label pair. Below is an example of answers to a `Current HIV status` question:

    ```json
    {
      "answers": [
        {
          "concept": "a896f3a6-1350-11df-a1f1-0026b9348838",
          "label": "HIV positive"
        },
        {
          "concept": "a896d2cc-1350-11df-a1f1-0026b9348838",
          "label": "HIV negative"
        },
        {
          "concept": "a899b50a-1350-11df-a1f1-0026b9348838",
          "label": "Unknown"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

- `type`: Optional.
- `historicalExpression`: Optional. Allows you to hook your input up to the `HistoricalEncounterDataService`. This service 'remembers' the last value entered into an input from the latest encounter and offers the user the option to reuse that value.

  ![Historical expressions](/img/historical-expressions.png)

- `required`: Optional. If set to **true**, the field is treated as a required field. Defaults to **false**.
- `validators`: Optional. An array in which you provide validation logic for the specific question. Read more about validation in the [Validating form fields](validating-form-fields) reference.
- `hide`: Optional. You can use this to define logic for hiding a question based on certain conditions.

  ```json
  {
    "hide": {
      "hideWhenExpression": "onArt!== 'a899b35c-1350-11df-a1f1-0026b9348838'"
    }

    // This logic hides the question with the `onArt` id if the value of its
    // concept does not match the supplied value
  }
  ```

- `questionInfo`
